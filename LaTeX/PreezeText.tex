\frametitle{Literature Review}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Civil War $\rightarrow$ Economic Performance
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Collier (1999) - \emph{destruction, disruption, diversion, dissaving, portfolio substitution}
	\item Kang \& Meernik (2005) - seek to explain rapid or stagnant post-war recovery
	\end{itemize}
	\item Economic Performance $\rightarrow$ Civil War
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Collier et al. (2003) - the conflict trap
	\item Miguel et al (2004) - rainfall IV for economic shocks
	\end{itemize}
	\item Disaggregating Civil Wars
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Pierskalla \& Hollenbach (2013) - cell phone coverage $\rightarrow$ rebel mobilization

\begin{block}{Our argument}
State economic performance in countries experiencing civil conflict is conditional on the proximity of conflict from major population, economic, and resource centers

\frametitle{FARC guerillas \& the Colombian government}

\begin{quote}FARC's strategy and [beliefs have] always been to make economic pressure on both, multinational companies and the Colombian government. This has been done by attacking oil and natural gas infrastructure affecting companies such as Pacific Rubiales Energy, Oxy and Ecopetrol. For non-fuel related international companies with subsidiaries in Colombia, such as Goodyear, Nestle, Microsoft, Toyota, among others, FARCâ€™s modus operandi was mainly racketeering, kidnappings and extortion.

\frametitle{Conclusions \& Next Steps}

\begin{block}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Novel approach in the study of civil conflict to distinguish between spatially dissimilar events
	\item Proximity of conflict to major cities explains disparate economic outcomes
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Next Steps}
\begin{itemize}
\item Account for other economically important locations (e.g., oil fields)
\item Alternative methods to address aggregation problem
\item More refined analysis within a country using subnational economic data
\end{itemize}
