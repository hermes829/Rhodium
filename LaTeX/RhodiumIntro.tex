Puzzle: Why do some conflicts have immediate impacts on a country's economy while others that fester for decades have little to none. 

	Mexico case: high levels of violence since 2008 but little effect on economic growth. Mexico facing serious internal political stability (civil violence, civil war...) yet this has little effect on economic growth as of yet. When should we expect to see the adverse effects of civil war manifest themselves in terms of lower economic growth?

	Cases apart from Mexico:
		Pakistan - NWFP
		India
		Israel
		Russia - Chechnya
		Columbia - FAARC

Spatial Dist Hypothesis: Location of conflicts to major cities and capitals determine effect of civil conflict on economic performance. thesis: conflicts only significantly dampens economic performance if they are a threat to major population centers. conflicts isolated in sparsely populated territories of the country have little to no effect on the whole.
