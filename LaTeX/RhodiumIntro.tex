Mexico case: high levels of violence since 2008 but little effect on economic growth

Mexico facing serious internal political stability (civil violence, civil war...) yet this has little effect on economic growth as of yet. When should we expect to see the adverse effects of civil war manifest themselves in terms of lower economic growth?

Cases apart from Mexico:
Pakistan - NWFP
India
Israel
Russia - Chechnya
Columbia - FAARC
