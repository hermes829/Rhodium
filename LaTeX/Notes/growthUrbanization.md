The location of production in space is a central part of the process by which economic 
prosperity and trade is created (Krugman 1991; Martin and Sunley 1996). It is a 
particularly noticeable feature of economic growth that the location of production in space 
tends towards agglomeration in a few places. The resulting prominence of cities and towns 
as a feature of the economic landscape has caused Hanson (1998:1) to remark that "most of 
the United States produces very little". The development of cities and towns and their 
subsequent fate is therefore important for economic growth and development. Puga and 
Venables (1999:292) recognise that "economic underdevelopment is a manifestation of the 
spatial pattern of agglomeration". 

One of the salient facts of international economic development has been of a spatial nature, 
namely the persistent urbanization across countries over the last 200 years (Zhang 
2002:91). In most cases urbanization has been accompanied by sharp declines in fertility 
and unprecedented increases in the growth of per capita output (see e.g., Chenery and 
Syrquin 1975). Henderson (2000:1) reports that the simple correlation coefficient across 
countries between the level of urbanization and GDP per capita is about 0.85. Persistent 
urbanization has led to the formation of huge concentrations of people and economic 
activity in cities and towns. This high density of people and firms can promote economic 
efficiency through information spillovers amongst producers, more efficiently functioning 
labour markets and savings in the transport costs of inputs and final products (Henderson 
2000:1). 

Apart from these static externalities there are also two types 
of dynamic externalities, namely Jacobs externalities and so-called Marshall-Arrow-Romer 
externalities, the latter due to knowledge sharing, learning and imitation in a particular area 
(Glaeser et al. 1992). In the endogenous growth literature, cities are important for 
economic growth precisely because they provide these dynamic information externalities 
that are important for innovation (as per Romer 1986; and Lucas 1988). 

Economists were early to point out that once a city had become established through the 
process of urbanization, it would tend to become a self-reinforcing growth centre through a 
process called cumulative causation (see Myrdal 1957). The new economic geography 
emphasises the role of agglomeration and cumulative causation. In the words of Krugman 
(1995), "activities tend to cluster where markets are large and markets become larger there 
where activities cluster".

It is a well-known fact that both production and households are not spread evenly
across space, but tend to concentrate in cities and regions of various sizes and
densities. This clustering is generally beneficial for both producers and households.
The concentration of households gives the firms a better opportunity to find an
appropriate workforce and at the same time find a market that is large enough for
their products. The concentration of firms also gives households a better chance in
finding suitable jobs. The concentration of firms may even become self-reinforcing.
Firms want to locate their business in regions with access to a large market, and
access to the market tends to be good in regions where a lot of firms locate their
business (Krugman, 1998).

During the last decade or so, economists have rediscovered geography. While urban and
regional economics have been and continue to be vibrant areas of research, other fields within
economics have increased their use of regional economies as laboratories in which to examine
different questions. Central to these lines of inquiry has been an attempt to understand why
economic activity tends to concentrate geographically. As it turns out, if we can explain
geographic concentration, then we can go a long way towards explaining important aspects of
international trade and economic growth.

A common theme in recent theory is that increasing returns to scale cause industry to
spatially agglomerate. Scale economies may be external to firms, such as those related to
knowledge spillovers, or internal to firms, which in combination with transport costs create
location-specific externalities. In either case, distance weakens the impact of external effects,
giving agents an incentive to locate near each other. Scale economies also feature prominently in
recent empirical work on economic geography. The literature is unified by a quest to estimate
the impact of agglomeration effects on regional outcomes. Most papers find evidence which is
presented as being consistent with agglomeration economies of some sort.

In a relatively early and influential line of work, Henderson (1974, 1988) suggests that
agglomeration economies are the result of positive spillovers between firms that share the same
location. While individual firms are perfectly competitive and perceive there to be constant
returns to scale, the agglomeration of economic activity generates externalities that raise the
productivity of all firms in a particular industry that share a given geographic location. These
externalities are assumed and so their source is not specified. The standard story, following
Marshal (1920), is that the geographic clustering of firms promotes learning and the exchange of
ideas between agents.

Lucas (1988) offers a related, dynamic model for a one- region closed economy, in which the accumulation of human capital generates positive spillovers. If one worker acquires a new skill, then all workers that share her location become more productive.

The spatial concentration of new activities also occurs at a much finer level of
disaggregation than suggested by state or province level data. In virtually all countries
development is associated with urbanisation and the growth of prime cities, often far more
dominant in modern developing countries than are (or were) such cities in the developed
world. The number of cities in the world with a population of more than 1 million went from
115 in 1960 to 416 in 2000; for cities of more than 4 million the increase was from 18 to 53,
and for more than 12 million from 1 to 11 (Henderson and Wang 2003).

These changes in spatial structure indicate a "lumpiness" in economic development. 
Far from being a process of smooth convergence, development is highly spatially
differentiated.
