<p>The location of production in space is a central part of the process by which economic prosperity and trade is created (Krugman 1991; Martin and Sunley 1996). It is a particularly noticeable feature of economic growth that the location of production in space tends towards agglomeration in a few places. The resulting prominence of cities and towns as a feature of the economic landscape has caused Hanson (1998:1) to remark that &quot;most of the United States produces very little&quot;. The development of cities and towns and their subsequent fate is therefore important for economic growth and development. Puga and Venables (1999:292) recognise that &quot;economic underdevelopment is a manifestation of the spatial pattern of agglomeration&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the salient facts of international economic development has been of a spatial nature, namely the persistent urbanization across countries over the last 200 years (Zhang 2002:91). In most cases urbanization has been accompanied by sharp declines in fertility and unprecedented increases in the growth of per capita output (see e.g., Chenery and Syrquin 1975). Henderson (2000:1) reports that the simple correlation coefficient across countries between the level of urbanization and GDP per capita is about 0.85. Persistent urbanization has led to the formation of huge concentrations of people and economic activity in cities and towns. This high density of people and firms can promote economic efficiency through information spillovers amongst producers, more efficiently functioning labour markets and savings in the transport costs of inputs and final products (Henderson 2000:1).</p>
<p>Apart from these static externalities there are also two types of dynamic externalities, namely Jacobs externalities and so-called Marshall-Arrow-Romer externalities, the latter due to knowledge sharing, learning and imitation in a particular area (Glaeser et al. 1992). In the endogenous growth literature, cities are important for economic growth precisely because they provide these dynamic information externalities that are important for innovation (as per Romer 1986; and Lucas 1988).</p>
<p>Economists were early to point out that once a city had become established through the process of urbanization, it would tend to become a self-reinforcing growth centre through a process called cumulative causation (see Myrdal 1957). The new economic geography emphasises the role of agglomeration and cumulative causation. In the words of Krugman (1995), &quot;activities tend to cluster where markets are large and markets become larger there where activities cluster&quot;.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that both production and households are not spread evenly across space, but tend to concentrate in cities and regions of various sizes and densities. This clustering is generally beneficial for both producers and households. The concentration of households gives the firms a better opportunity to find an appropriate workforce and at the same time find a market that is large enough for their products. The concentration of firms also gives households a better chance in finding suitable jobs. The concentration of firms may even become self-reinforcing. Firms want to locate their business in regions with access to a large market, and access to the market tends to be good in regions where a lot of firms locate their business (Krugman, 1998).</p>

<p>During the last decade or so, economists have rediscovered geography. While urban and regional economics have been and continue to be vibrant areas of research, other fields within economics have increased their use of regional economies as laboratories in which to examine different questions. Central to these lines of inquiry has been an attempt to understand why economic activity tends to concentrate geographically. As it turns out, if we can explain geographic concentration, then we can go a long way towards explaining important aspects of international trade and economic growth.</p>
<p>A common theme in recent theory is that increasing returns to scale cause industry to spatially agglomerate. Scale economies may be external to firms, such as those related to knowledge spillovers, or internal to firms, which in combination with transport costs create location-specific externalities. In either case, distance weakens the impact of external effects, giving agents an incentive to locate near each other. Scale economies also feature prominently in recent empirical work on economic geography. The literature is unified by a quest to estimate the impact of agglomeration effects on regional outcomes. Most papers find evidence which is presented as being consistent with agglomeration economies of some sort.</p>
<p>In a relatively early and influential line of work, Henderson (1974, 1988) suggests that agglomeration economies are the result of positive spillovers between firms that share the same location. While individual firms are perfectly competitive and perceive there to be constant returns to scale, the agglomeration of economic activity generates externalities that raise the productivity of all firms in a particular industry that share a given geographic location. These externalities are assumed and so their source is not specified. The standard story, following Marshal (1920), is that the geographic clustering of firms promotes learning and the exchange of ideas between agents.</p>
<p>Lucas (1988) offers a related, dynamic model for a one- region closed economy, in which the accumulation of human capital generates positive spillovers. If one worker acquires a new skill, then all workers that share her location become more productive.</p>

<p>The spatial concentration of new activities also occurs at a much finer level of disaggregation than suggested by state or province level data. In virtually all countries development is associated with urbanisation and the growth of prime cities, often far more dominant in modern developing countries than are (or were) such cities in the developed world. The number of cities in the world with a population of more than 1 million went from 115 in 1960 to 416 in 2000; for cities of more than 4 million the increase was from 18 to 53, and for more than 12 million from 1 to 11 (Henderson and Wang 2003).</p>
<p>These changes in spatial structure indicate a &quot;lumpiness&quot; in economic development. Far from being a process of smooth convergence, development is highly spatially differentiated.</p>
