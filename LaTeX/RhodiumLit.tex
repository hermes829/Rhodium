\subsection{Previous Research on Third-Party Intervention}
\label{lit}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Third-party intervention on behalf of a rebel group is more likely to occur when there are ideological/ethnic linkages between rebel groups and actors in other countries (Carment, James \& Rowlands, 1997; Bryman et al., 2001; Salehyan, Gleditsch \& Cunningham, 2011)

	\item Many studies show that third-party interventions in civil wars are associated with wars of longer duration (Balch-Lindsay \& Enterline, 2000; Elbadawi \& Sambanis, 2000; and Regan, 2002)

	\item Other studies suggest that biased third-party support increases the likelihood that a civil war will end in a victory by the supported group (Balch-Lindsay, Enterline \& Joyce, 2006; Mason, Weingarten \& Fett, 1999)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computational Models of Civil War}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) provides a bottom-up method for building complex systems
	% \pause
	\item A number of studies have used this technique in an attempt to build realistic computational models of civil war (Cederman \& Girardin, 2007; Cioffi-Revilla \& Rouleau, 2010; Weidmann \& Salehyan, 2010)
