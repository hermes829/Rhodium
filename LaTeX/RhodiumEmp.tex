\subsection{Data and Sample}

Conflict data: comes from PRIO Conflict Location Even Data 

	Note data aggregation choices.  Multiple conflicts in one country?

	Note dropping interstate conflict.

City data: Collection of major population centers by year 

World Bank data: Econ indicators 

Variables: Determined distance between conflicts in a year and city centers. then calculcate min distance to determine effect on conflict 

\subsection{Sample and Estimation Method}

Sample: Only country-years undergoing a civil conflict. Coverage restricted to 1989-2008. 

Measured as a random effects model with country effects 

\subsection{Results}

Maybe we should begin this section by showing the distribution of econ performance among the cntry-years in the dataset. this would illustrate that there is noticeable variation in economic performance to explain. 

Conflicts occuring more proximate to major cities have stronger adverse effects on economic performance than those farther away.
