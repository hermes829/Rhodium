\section{Data and Sample}

\subsection{Conflict and City Data}

To measure economic performance we use annual percent change in logged GDP collected from the World Development Indicators at the World Bank. We choose to focus on year over change in logged GDP because we expect conflicts proximate to major cities to lead to immediate reductions in overall growth. Unlike much of the extant literature in constructing our dependent variable we focus on year over change instead of a ten year average. This allows us to estimate the direct effect of conflict on economic performance in that year. A ten-year average approach would hide important variation in our dependent variable that can be explained by the proximity of conflict to economic centers.

Our key independent variable on the location of conflicts come from the PRIO Conflict Site Dataset. This dataset contains geo-referenced armed conflict events from 1989 to 2008.\footnote{We only include examine the effect of internal armed conflicts.} In total this dataset provides us with almost 800 geo-referenced conflict-year cases. 

A crucial part of our work here involved determining the capital and major city centers for country-years referenced in the PRIO dataset.\footnote{To gather information on capital and major cities we turned to yearly editions of The World Almanac from 1989 to 2008.} Typically, the Alamanacs listed at least three major cities for each country and year from 1989 to 2008. After we had gathered a yearly list of major cities by country, we determined the centroid location of each city using Google's Geocoding API. 

In figure \ref{fig:CityConfMap}, we show the geographic distribution of conflicts and cities. The centroid locations of conflicts are shown by red dots. Not surprisingly, we can see that in many cases conflict locations are clustered within specific parts of a country. In most cases, this clustering is indicative of the same conflict moving within the geographic boundaries of a country over time. The blue diamonds in \ref{fig:CityConfMap} denote the locations of major cities as identified in The World Alamanacs from 1989 to 2008. Countries shaded in grey are those for which no armed conflict took place in this period according to the PRIO dataset.

Our analysis focuses on exploring variations in economic growth in countries undergoing conflict by the proximity of those conflicts to major cities, thus we restrict our sample to only those countries that are listed as having conflicts in the PRIO dataset. To determine proximity, we calculate the distance in kilometers between the centroid of each of the conflicts with the centroids of city locations. Meaning that for each year we determine the distance between every conflict and every major city within a state. For example, in figure \ref{fig:columbiaMap} we show the location of armed conflicts in Colombia, dots colored in shades of red, and the major cities therein, blue diamonds.\footnote{One armed conflict involving rebel actors and the Colombian government occurred outside of Colombia's borders.} For Colombia each of the red dots represents the same conflict but a different year, with earlier years shaded in light red and later years shaded in dark red. Thus for every year we made six distance calculations -- one for every city.

\end{figure}

Our dependent variable is at the country-year and our key independent variable, distance between conflicts and major cities, is at the conflict-country-year level. To deal with this, we aggregate up to the country-year level by calculating the minimum logged distance any conflict is from a major city. Thus if a country faced, for example, four conflicts in one year, the datapoint that we would aggregate up to the country-year level would be for the conflict that was closest to a major city. This obviously is somewhat problematic as we end up discarding the information from the other conflicts. At the same time, we argue that this choice of aggregation is what conforms closest to our theoretical claims about economic activity only being severely disrupted in cases of conflicts being proximate to major cities. From the PRIO dataset we also bring in additional information about that conflict, specifically its intensity, the area of conflict, whether the conflict involves a territorial dispute, and its duration.

Last, we include a number of additional control measures. First, we control for a country's total, logged land area to differentiate between the proximity effects of conflicts within large and small countries. We also control for a couple of macroeconomic variables that could affect year over year changes in GDP, specifically, lagged inflation and whether or not the state is an upper income country, as defined by the World Bank.

Add in descriptors for each of these variables and expectations of their sign.

To estimate the model we use random effects clustered on countries. The model we estimate is shown below:

\begin{align*}
	\% \Delta Log(GDP_{i,t}) &= \beta_{1}(Ln(Min. \; Conflict \; Dist.)_{i,t}) \\
	& \;+\; \beta_{2}(Conflict \; Intensity_{i,t}) \;+\; \beta_{3}(Conflict \; Type_{i,t}) \\
	& \;+\; \beta_{4}(Conflict \; Duration_{i,t}) \;+\; \beta_{5}(Ln(Conflict \; Area)_{i,t}) \\	
	& \;+\; \beta_{6}(Upper \; Income_{i,t}) \;+\; \beta_{7}(Inflation_{i,t-1}) \\
	&  \;+\; \beta_{8}(Democracy_{i,t-1}) \;+\; \beta_{9}(World \; GDP \; Growth_{t}) \\
	& \;+\; \mu_{i,t} \;+\; \epsilon_{i,t}
\end{align*}

\section{Results}
\label{findings} 

We depict the results of our model in figure \ref{fig:coefPlot}. Most of the findings here are in line with our theoretical expectations. We find that higher levels of conflict intensity are associated with lower levels of GDP growth. The effect of conflict type is positive, indicating that non-territorial disputes are related to lower levels of GDP growth as well. Surprisingly, conflicts that are of a longer duration are, on average, not having a negative effect on GDP growth. 

Most importantly, we find strong support for our key hypothesis relating the proximity of a conflict to lower levels of GDP growth. The fact that the logged, minimum conflict distance variable is positive indicates that conflicts closer to major cities have an adverse effect on economic growth.

Grey indicates that the estimate is not significantly different from zero at either of those intervals.}

\end{figure}

To assess the substantive effect of the minimum conflict distance variable we conduct a number of simulations. We set up scenarios where we hold all variables to their median except for the logged, minimum conflict distance, which we range from its minimum to maximum value. Next, we conduct 1,000 random draws from a multivariate normal to obtain distributions for the point estimates of each of the regression coefficients. After obtaining these distributions, we calculate the predicted value of GDP growth based on the conditions set by the scenarios. We plot the results of this analyis in figure \ref{fig:simsPlot}.

\end{figure}

Here we can clearly see that conflicts located farther away from major cities have almost no adverse impact on economic growth. On average, countries for which conflicts are farther away see almost no declines in economic growth and, in fact, are likely to still see positive growth. Where we see more variation, however, is on the effect of conflicts near to major cities. Although on average our model estimates that these more proximate conflicts are associated with negative levels of economic growth our estimate of this effect is highly uncertain. This just indicates to us that more work needs to be done in parsing out possible variation in economic growth levels for those countries that are experiencing conflicts proximate to their major cities. Nonetheless, overall our results are quite in line with our theoretical expectations.

\subsection{Model Performance}

To assess the accuracy and performance of these estimates we employ a simple two-fold cross validation procedure. We use this procedure both to determine the robustness of our coefficient estimates when estimated on different subsamples of our dataset, and to assess how well the results of our model would generalize to an independent dataset. To begin the cross-validation, we split the 653 sanction cases in our dataset into six approximately equal subsets. We then run each model shown in Table \ref{tab:regResults} six times, where in each iteration we left out one subsample to use as a test set. This allows us to compare the prediction accuracy of each model, thereby helping us to determine the gains from incorporating the reciprocity covariates that are key to our argument.

	\caption{In and out of sample performance.}
	\label{fig:rmsePlot}
\end{figure}

First, however, we show the results for our reciprocity covariates when we rerun our survival analysis on each of the six folds from the cross-validation. This analysis helps us to understand whether some of the subsets in our dataset follow a different pattern than what is in the broader set.\footnote{\cite{beck2008time}} Figure \ref{fig:crossval} shows that this is not the case for the analysis we present here, the coefficient estimates for compliance and sanction reciprocity remain consistent across each of these subsamples.\footnote{The parameter estimates for the other covariates also remain consistent across each of the six folds but we leave them out here due to space constraints.}
