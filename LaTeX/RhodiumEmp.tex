\subsection{Data and Sample}

Dependent variable: World Bank data GDP per capita growth 

Key Independent variables: 

	Conflict data: comes from PRIO Conflict Location Even Data 

		Note data aggregation choices.  Multiple conflicts in one country?

		Note dropping interstate conflict.

	City data: Collection of major population centers by year 

	Variables: Determined distance between conflicts in a year and city centers. then calculcate min distance to determine effect on conflict 

\subsection{Sample and Estimation Method}

Sample: Only country-years undergoing a civil conflict. Coverage restricted to 1989-2008. 

Measured as a random effects model with country effects 

\subsection{Results} 

Conflicts occuring more proximate to major cities have stronger adverse effects on economic performance than those farther away. 

Use simulations to determine substantive effects
