just one broad note, since MPSA is just around the corner I think for now we should just focus on using the gdp per capita growth variable and not worry about trying to generalize to other econ perfrmance indicators. 

* Introduction: 

	* Puzzle: Why do some conflicts have immediate impacts on a country's economy while others that fester for decades have little to no impact. 

	* Background: Show charts of Mexico and/or India's growth in GDP per capita versus number of conflicts 

	* Spatial Dist Hypothesis: Location of conflicts to major cities and capitals determine effect of civil conflict on economic performance 

* Literature: 

	* We need to fill in. I actually havent done much or any reading on this subject. 

* Spatial Dist Hypothesis: 

	* Maybe we could begin this section by showing a chart that tracks the effect of conflict duration on economic performance. The purpose of the chart would be to show that long running conflicts are not permanently depressing economic performance. 

	* Case Study Approach: Maybe we can use the case study of India as a way to explain our hypothesis: 

		* Key features of the case study would be: 

		* Describing India's long running conflicts and how that has done seemingly little to dampen its pace of economic growth. 

	* Or instead of relying on just one case study maybe we can walk through the example for a number of countries. 

* Data and Sample: 

	* Conflict data: comes from PRIO Conflict Location Even Data 

	* City data: Collection of major population centers by year 

	* World Bank data: Econ indicators 

	* Variables: Determined distance between conflicts in a year and city centers. then calculcate min distance to determine effect on conflict 

	* Sample: Only country-years undergoing a civil conflict. Coverage restricted to 1989-2008. 

* Estimation: 

	* Measured as a random effects model with country effects 

* Findings: 

	* Maybe we should begin this section by showing the distribution of econ performance among the cntry-years in the dataset. this would illustrate that there is noticeable variation in economic performance to explain. 

	* Conflicts occuring more proximate to major cities have stronger adverse effects on economic performance than those farther away. 

* Contribution: 

	* Contributed to our understanding of why some civil conflicts impact economic performance more severely than others using a novel spatial approach.
