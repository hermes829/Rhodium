    - It will be fairly important to benchmark the results based on distance between conflict location and urban center against the overall effect of conflict. In other words, we’d like to know if having any conflict lowers GDP, and if this effect is even stronger if its located closer to urban areas. To capture this, the authors should start with a simple specification that regresses GDP growth on a dummy for if any conflict occurred. Then they should introduce an interaction between this dummy variable and the conflict distance variable. The coefficient on the dummy in this second specification would then capture effects of 0 distance, or if conflicts occurred in cities.
    - Robustness. The strategy that consists to run a six-fold cross- validation is convincing. In the same spirit, I would like to see the same exercise when one country is left out of the sample.

* Instead of treating conflict intensity as a control, it would be useful to re-do the specifications in point 3 above but just restricting to the incidents coded as wars and then restricting to the lower intensity effects. Then the authors can test to see if coefficients on the former are in fact larger.
* Data on cities. To avoid issues linked to reverse causation, I would consider the list of urban centers
* Definition of variables. The authors take the minimum distance to the conflict as explanatory variable. I would like to see alternative measures to ensure that the results are not sensitive to the definition of the main variable. For instance, the weighted (by the distance) sum of the number of events is a credible candidate as an alternative measure.

*  More information should be provided on how conflict events make it into the Conflict Site Dataset. For example, Figure 1 suggests too sparse picture of violent events in Colombia, given that nearly 1/3rd of the Colombian territory was war affected over this period.

*  I like the use of the descriptive cases but more should be done with these if they will be included. In particular, the economic dynamic of these countries should be mentioned to clarify how the effect of conflict on GDP maps to the hypotheses advanced in the paper. I also wondered about the focus on conflict in the NE in India. Naxalite conflict has also spread rapidly and is also located in rural areas (which is consistent with the authors’ point), so this would be natural to draw upon as well.
