thesis: conflicts only significantly dampens economic performance if they are a threat to major population centers. conflicts isolated in sparsely populated territories of the country have little to no effect on the whole. point to the imai & weinstein paper as an example of this. 

Laying out our hypothesis in a formal way

	Columbia +/- (BR), Pakistan - (SM), Philippines (BR), Israel (SM), Chad (BR), Democratic Republic of Congo (SM)
	(  + = Case where conflict was close to center and economy declined; - = Case where conflict far from center and no effect on econ )

End with a chart to show the distribution of econ performance among conflict-cntry-years to illustrate that there is noticeable variation in economic performance to explain. ending with this might help us lead into the empirics section and 

	seems like the density plot you've already made in the models.R file highlights that the gdp growth var is kind of normal centered at zero which is good for us
